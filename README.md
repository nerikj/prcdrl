This is a very basic map generator using [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) polygons. It's based on [this article](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/) and is just an experiment where I wanted to learn more about procedurally generating content (primarily for game development).

## Setup

```
npm install
npm start
```

Access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Debug mode can be enabled by providing the query parameter `debug=true`. Currently, the only thing it does is to show the mouse coordinates.
